# GPU Price Tracker

## Overview

The GPU Price Tracker is a powerful web scraping and price aggregation tool built to help you find the best deals on graphics cards in the ever-fluctuating GPU market. With this project, I have leveraged Next.js 13, React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Prisma ORM to create a comprehensive solution for tracking GPU prices across various retailers.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 13**: A powerful React framework for building server-rendered React applications.
- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability.
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust relational database management system used for efficient data storage.
- **Docker**: Containerization technology for simplified deployment and consistent environments.
- **Prisma ORM**: A modern database toolkit for TypeScript and Node.js.
- **Cheerio**: A library for parsing and manipulating HTML and XML documents.
- **Puppeteer**: A headless browser automation tool for web scraping.

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: I have implemented multiple web scraping methods, utilizing libraries like Cheerio and Puppeteer to extract GPU models and their corresponding prices from a range of online retailers. This ensures a broad coverage of GPU listings.

- **Price Aggregation**: The project aggregates the scraped data, providing you with a consolidated view of GPU prices from multiple retailers in one place. This allows you to easily compare prices and make informed purchasing decisions.

- **Next.js and React**: The front end of the GPU Price Tracker is powered by Next.js and React, providing a fast and responsive user interface for a seamless browsing experience.

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used throughout the project to enhance code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity.

- **PostgreSQL and Prisma ORM**: GPU data is stored efficiently in a PostgreSQL database, managed with Prisma ORM, ensuring data integrity and enabling advanced querying capabilities.

- **Docker Containerization**: The PostgreSQL database is containerized using Docker, simplifying deployment and ensuring consistent environments across different setups.
